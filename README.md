### Hi there 👋
I’m currently working on symbolic music research 🎵 using DNNs, including
- arranging music for musical instruments 🎹🎸🎺
- creating and manipulating musical scores 🎼
- music information retrieval 🔍

My recent work ["Score Transformer"](https://github.com/suzuqn/ScoreTransformer) focuses on making musical scores from MIDI.
